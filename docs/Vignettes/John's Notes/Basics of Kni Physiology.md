# Basics of Kni Physiology
written by John Hayes

Say Saul accidentally takes a finger off while trying to open a rift. We know rifts aren't forgiving. A thick, glowing, light purple liquid drops onto the floor from the wound. This liquid is called "essence." Focusing on the wound, he expends willpower regaining the lost digit. Willpower is latent, stored focus energy.

This is an ability all kni have, it's the heal focus, part of the life class. Their organs, known as "nodes," are made of semisolid focus energy-based matter, simply called "semisolid," doing the jobs that ours would. For example, taking food and making it into power, which directly fuels them as they are made mostly of energy. This is not required for the kni to live, as they do pull energy from realmspace as well, but eating also . Kni do have hearts of sorts, but it's only to circulate the essence in their bodies to keep willpower uniform. It's called their "core node," or just their "core." This is probably why focusing makes them physically exhausted.

And for the ash left behind when a kni's energy is claimed...That's what they are without focus energy. All they are is literally just a tiny amount of ash kept in solution with focus energy. Without energy, a kni is just white ash.

A note on claiming: Kni can already pull focus energy from realmspace. Doing so is slow but effortless. A kni can also pull energy from another kni that is too weak to resist, literally pulling their energy until the target is ash. Grisly stuff.

Makes me happy I attended the focus classes way back when.
