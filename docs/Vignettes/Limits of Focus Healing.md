Focus healing cannot undo scars. It can do a lot, sure. But focus healing can not remove a human's scars. Focus healing might be nearly unstoppable(depending on available willpower) for kni(kni don't scar for this exact reason), but that's natural for beings made mostly of energy alone. Focus healing on humans has limits. Like, focus healing can't regrow a human limb, but it can cauterize the wound and heal skin. It can't regrow a missing bone, but it can fuse a broken one.

And sickness?

The ancient humanlike kni didn't have much luck trying to heal the Man...much to the dismay of the ancient replica kni.
