# On Female Kni's Form: Possible Reasons
written by John Hayes

---

We could launch into millions of theories to why female kni have breasts. And I could melt into my chair thinking about it for way too long. Let's do neither. I'll give you the top theories.

Theory 1: Female kni have breasts for readability.
	This is the most possible reason in my eyes. As we know, kni are not mammals, and do not produce milk. Perhaps otherwise, there would be little to tell focus signature by? From what I get from Shelia, kni can "feel" focus signatures, so maybe not for up-close. Perhaps it's for readability at a distance?

Theory 2: They store energy in them.
	There is no proof to this theory. Female kni's breasts have been found to only consist of semisolid.

Theory 3: Sex appeal.
	I hate how some people actually believe this. There's literally nothing there. This feels like a middle school joke. Kni literally don't have sex, why would they need appeal?

It's probably obvious which theory I favor.
