# Kni Eyes and Glow Meaning
written by John Hayes

---

Kni eyes are similar in structure to our own. When not focusing, they have a defined sclera, iris, and pupil. But sometimes, when giving focus their all, their eyes will glow entirely. I've only seen it happen once or twice.

Kni irises almost always glow. They're just little halos of warm white in dark scenes. Glow color is dependent on kni type. Humanlike and monklike kni both glow a warm white, whereas replica kni glow a cool, bluish white. Amount of glow is proportional to the kni's willpower, or the amount of stored focus energy a kni has at their disposal at that one time.

Kni eyes are noticeably dull before being claimed. It's when they're at their weakest.

Jeez, just thinking how imposing and intimidating a replica kni would look in a dark room, with their cold, bluish-white eyes...At least it's the only part of them that their form focus can't change.
