# Alloying
written by Sapphire Bronze

---

The parent kni take the wood ash(birch is customary, but other species can be used) in hand and they link their fingers together(not essential), palm up, right and left hands close together. They both focus together and, with it taking a great deal of energy, an infant kni alloy is created slowly, fully formed but not yet full size. 

It can be performed without the ash, but it's harder and takes more energy. The alloy kni, now full size, rests in the parents' hands, still glowing slightly, and will for a number of hours as the new kni settles into its new focus signature and is able to pull their own energy from realmspace.

You know that point where you're lifting something really heavy for a while, then take a breath and unintentionally drop it? That's a failed alloy.

I would probably akin the feeling of alloying to rolling a good-sized, round stone uphill, until you summit. Then it rolls down the other side effortlessly.
