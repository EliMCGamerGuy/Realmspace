It was started by the created beings from the created realm who learned how to pass through realmspace. Realmspace, at that time, was a dark, shapeless void with where the realms lie being mostly guesswork, and its existence and how to traverse it being a closely guarded secret. The created beings built a civilization in the first realm, energized by the raw, power-rich air there. They called this raw power \"kna,\" or \"unrefined energy.\" Generations passed and the method they used to pass through realmspace had been almost completely lost. </p> <p>About seven generations in, the realm faced a famine like no other they had before. The soil bore no grain, nor did the kna in the air help at all. As it continued, the town's food supply dwindled, and people started to starve. One man, however, worked through the starvation, reading into the night by candlelight alone. One man who had no family of his own.</p> <p>The man read of taking the kna and pulling it, gathering it and focusing it into an ability. Refining the kna into \"kno,\" or \"focused energy.\" The technique had almost completely been lost due to nobody deeming it necessary anymore. But the man read night and day, convinced that the kno abilities would be their solution.</p> <p>After years of reading, experimenting, re-reading, and experimenting again, the man was able to open a rift to realmspace. The town, almost gone, started pouring all they had into helping the man, as he was their only hope. With their help, the man learned how to bind kno, navigate realmspace by feeling kna, and the three separate classes of kno.</p> <p>After more months of experimentation, and with the two remaining peoples' help, the man learned that he could form kno into a line, bind it to the realm, and pull it through a rift. As the rift closes, you would think that it snapping shut would sever the line, but the kno of the line kept the rift open, microscopically. Just enough for the line and airborne kna to cross. The man would then run this line to another realm, through another rift, and bind the other side. This pulled the realms together and allowed fresh kna to spread through the realms from realmspace, albeit slowly. As the man weaved the realms together, realmspace itself began to take a more physical form. Very small sand and dust particles would pass through the rifts, and would settle in realmspace, pushed around by winds created by the flow of kna. Realmspace started to form a black desert.</p> <p>After the man had finished weaving the realms together, he returned to his home town in the first realm. But there was nobody left. The crops just wouldn't grow, no matter what they tried. There were no animals in the realm to hunt, either. The man could no longer stay in the first realm, he had to find another home.</p> <p>The man traveled through the realms he bound together, watching the weather, studying the plants, smelling the breeze, observing the animals, tasting the flowing water. He eventually settled on one singular realm. The realm he deemed to be the most worthy other than the created realm. He settled in the fourth realm, a realm with clean water, forests of trees, flourishing and familiar fauna, and usually calm skies. The man dug in, and built for himself a cabin on a hill.</p> <p>Time did pass, and the man found that the ground took crops rather well. He had a much better first harvest than he ever did in the first realm. And when he wasn't tending to his crop, he enjoyed the scenery that the fourth realm provided. The rolling hills, wide, flowing fields, tall forests, and open ocean. And for a while, the man was satisfied.</p> <p>But the man grew restless. He had knit together the realms to save his town, his people, but it was too late. He pulled the kno into his hands. He never truly had a family to call his own, and he had lost the very people he was trying to set free. Taking into his hands the ash of the fourth realm's trees to give kno form, he melded the kno into a being. He called the being \"kni,\" meaning \"Energy given shape.\" (AMY NOTE: I transliterated \"kni,\" and it literally means \"energy thing.\" Prefix \"kn\" = energy, suffix \"i\" = physical object. So, when we refer to ourselves in knilang, we're literally calling ourselves \"energy things.\" That is stupendously on the nose.)</p> <p>The being had pitch-black skin and hair, with warmly glowing eyes. The man taught the kni how to pull kna, form kno, and create illusions. He taught the kni the importance of recording and preservation. The man had made for himself a kni son, using kno and ash alone. And for a while again, he was satisfied.</p> <p>Years passed, and the man noticed that his firauftkni could not work the farm fast enough alone, or with his help. It was rare if they had food left over before the next harvest because the crop would rot before it could be harvested and preserved. So the man took kno and more ash into his hands, and created another kni son. The man, having practiced countless hours with kno, could create much more finely, and created the kni to look more like his peers had. The second kni son had light skin, brown hair, and the same warmly glowing eyes. He taught his sirauftkni how to pull kna and form kno, and to take the power of life into his hands to help it grow, heal, or form vines. And once the sirauftkni was old enough to help the first, they no longer had worries of crop spoiling in the field. (AMY NOTE: \"Firauftkni,\" \"sirauftkni\" and later \"thirauftkni\" are antiquated terms transliterated to \"first descended kni,\" \"second descended kni,\" and \"third descended kni.\" Later translations of this text translate these to \"first son,\" and so on.)</p> <p>One day, a lone wolf laid hidden in the field, and attacked the firauftkni when the man wasn't looking. When the man heard his sons' shouts, he came running, with kno hardened into a sword. The man fended off the wolf, but the firauftkni's injuries were severe. With both him and his sirauftkni healing the firauftkni, he made a full recovery, but the man realized that he cannot defend his two sons from a hostile world alone. So again, he took kno and ash into his hands, and created another son. He created his thirauftkni with the ability to change his form, to blend in with any being he'd seen. To tell them apart, he gave this son bluish glowing eyes. He taught his thirauftkni how to pull kna and form kno, to fight and defend, and how to harden kno into a sword, a shield, or spears. The thirauftkni grew, and he took the lessons well. When he was old enough, he started accompanying the other two sons in the field as his father wished, fending off any dangers that may pose a threat.</p> <p>Years passed, and the man became very ill. He would cough night and day, often with blood, and his temperature was higher than normal. The sirauftkni tried everything to help him, to lower his temperature and to heal his lungs, but it wouldn't help for long. The time came one night that the man gathered his sons. </p> <p>Between coughs, the man taught his sons that through his and his peoples' research in using kno, he learned that everyone has a different form or signature to their kno. He taught them that the only pure kno signature was kno formed my humans hands, and that theirs were simple. He said that their signatures will become one of two types, dictate how they grow, and will be essential in creation of new kni, or to \"alkni.\" Pure kno can alloy alone, and they would be able to alloy alone for some time, but at some point their kno signatures will be too impure and alloying will require two kni of different signature types. At the end of the lesson, the firauftkni and thirauftkni went to bed, but the sirauftkni stayed with the man, trying in vain to heal the man as he coughed blood again. The sirauftkni stayed by the man throughout the night. By daybreak, the man had passed away. (AMY NOTE: \"Alkni\": \"Al\"(to combine) + \"kn\"(energy) + \"i\"(physical, an object, a person, thing), \"Alkni\" = To combine physical energy things. What we would call alloying today.)</p> <p>When the firauftkni had learned of the news, he devoted his life to being the fourth realm's first history keeper. When the thirauftkni learned of the news, he became furious. He was convinced that the sirauftkni hadn't tried hard enough, despite the sirauftkni's defense. When the firauftkni tried to calm the thirauftkni, he pulled his kno sword on him, saying that he didn't even help. The firauftkni, knowing that even if he did try, his illusions wouldn't help, stepped back and allowed the thirauftkni to leave.</p> <p>The firauftkni, in honor of his father, collected his father's writing and research, and assembled it into books and organized it by topic for future generations to read and learn from, and eventually had a large family. The sirauftkni, in honor of his father, took life into his hands, created villages with woven vines, kept livestock, and eventually had a large family.</p> <p>The thirauftkni was never again heard of by the fir or sir.</p> <p>(AMY NOTE: It's a chilling read, knowing what we know now...Would the man have created his third son if he knew what he'd become? It's really a shame the names have been lost to time. I swear, I should know at least the first son's name. It's on the tip of my tongue.)</p>"},{"location":"Acts/Act%201%20-%20Copper%20Steel%27s%20Journal/","title":"Act 1 - Copper Steel's Journal","text":"<p>Annotated by Copper Steel in 5AU</p>"},{"location":"Acts/Act%201%20-%20Copper%20Steel%27s%20Journal/#entry-1-5101533-1bu","title":"Entry 1 (5/10/1533) (1BU)","text":"<p>Mom gave me this journal when I turned 17, saying that it's a good thing to write things down.

Brutal, bloody, and unnecessary.\"</p> <p>( Amy ) \"Do you remember where you were stationed on Sirmont 17th, 1533?\"</p> <p>( Lt. Mason ) \"Yep. Station 58, near the northern city limit. Been there for about 3 years. After that, they changed my station to station 27, near the northeastern city limit, where the perimeter had been set up. On the 18th the replica kni made contact with the first line initial guards, and we had front row seats. Replica kni streaming down the northeastern hill as foxes, wolves, tigers, and kni. They were overwhelmed almost immediately, and we had to step in to hold the perimeter.\"</p> <p>( Amy ) \"What do you think the guard underestimated the most, the amount of replica kni or their unity?\"</p> <p>( Lt. Mason ) \"Probably both, but mostly their unity. Until then, we had never seen the replica kni come together at such a scale. Even today, we have wolf packs patrolling the streets, never alone. But there were also much more replica kni then than we expected. The working theory is that there were more replica kni camps over the northeastern hill, past the existing camp.\"</p> <p>( Amy ) \"You said that the guard was overwhelmed. Can you say how you felt, in that moment?\"</p> <p>( Lt. Mason ) \"None of us had known that we were overwhelmed until it was too late. We all had to hold the line, unaware that the line was slowly creeping backwards. When we realized we were overwhelmed, we- at least, I- felt hopeless as the perimeter faded.\"</p> <p>( Amy ) \"Was there ever a moment that you thought to yourself that the guard could still win?\"</p> <p>( Lt. Mason ) \"Yeah. We're trained for battle. But...not quite battle against replica kni as animals. The morale hit when we knew that the initial guards were overwhelmed was huge, but it also drove us to fight harder. For a few seconds, we all felt unstoppable.\"</p> <p>( Amy ) \"How did your superiors react when the perimeter was breached?\"</p> <p>( Lt. Mason ) \"Oh. Panic, mostly.

This gets kind of gross, are you sure?\"</p> <p>( Amy ) \"I can edit it.\"</p> <p>( Lt. Mason ) \"Ok. </p> <p>He had taken a replica kni's arm off with his sword. This is typically a pretty important pick, they don't usually know heal focus. So the replica kni doubled over, but then collected some of his essence in his hand, throwing it at Tom, catching him off guard. </p> <p>The replica kni took the moment of vulnerability and speared Tom in the torso with his off-hand.

I have lived through the replica's hostile takeover of Crystallyne, and ultimately Realm 04. Afterwards, I was a realmspace nomad for ten years until I managed to open a direct rift back to realm 04. During those ten years, I sharpened my focus, as dad would've wanted me to. I have discovered a few advanced focuses on my own, like focus binding and using major illusion to mask my energy. They are weak, but I can perform them reliably. Several attempts on my life have been made by replica scouts, which taught me that my home is not gone. Here, in Realm 04, I have joined the resistance, creatively named \"the Resistance,\" lead by Johnathan Hayes, brother of the late Jessica Hayes. My girlfriend is Amethyst Silver. My best friend is Zinc Lithium. With my focus sword in one hand, focus shield on the other, and allies beside me, I plan to fight against the replica and avenge my father.</p> <p>Modern Amy: \"Pretty confident headcanoning calling me your 'girlfriend' while being stuck in a cabin in realmspace.\" Modern Copper: <code>KERNEL PANIC</code> Modern Amy: \"I don't hate it, but we're not there yet.\"</p> <p>*(Amethyst is trying to take it seriously.

Each illusion taking more energy and concentration to keep. Minor illusions are small, confined to a very small roughly 2ft range from the focus point, but are very simple and easy to maintain. Major illusions scale concentration and energy cost with size, and thus abide by no such arbitrary restriction. Physical illusion is the ability to make something appear, and even be able to interact with other objects. It takes a lot of concentration to maintain, but energy cost scales with size like major illusions. Monklike kni typically find this class to be the most natural class to specialize in.</p> <p>The life class has grow, vine, and heal. The grow focus allows the focuser to accelerate the growth of a focused plant, granted the plant has the nutrients and water required to do so. Vine allows the focuser to grow vines in a focused area. Most of the time, pre-existing plants and soil is not a requirement. The heal focus is the most important of the life class, and is taught to all kni in schools. Heal focus allows the focuser to transfer energy between types, allowing a kni to heal his or herself, another kni, or a human's wounds. However, for humans, the wound must be washed before closing, or you risk infection. Given enough time and energy, a kni can completely heal even lost limbs or nearly mortal wounds. For humans, it is much more restrictive, limiting more to only being able to close wounds. Humanlike kni typically find this class to be the most natural class to specialize in.</p> <p>The combat class consists of shield, sword, spear, and blackfire. The shield focus typically creates a translucent purple shield attached to the focuser's focused arm, but can take many shapes in practice. The shield's strength is directly connected to the focuser's available willpower. If the focuser runs out of energy, the shield shatters and fades away. The sword focus is similar to the shield focus, and is often used in tandem with it, but its shape is much more standardized. It appears most often as a translucent purple short sword, but some opt to focus it as a greatsword, holding it with both hands. Similarly to shield focus, it is susceptible to shattering and fading away if the focuser runs out of energy. Spear focus has two forms: pre-thrown at nearly the speed of sound, and stationary as a held weapon. However, few rely on spear focus as a main weapon. The spear focus, like the other two focuses, appears as a translucent purple spear about 4ft long and is susceptible to shattering and fading when out of energy. Blackfire is a restricted focus, not taught in schools. It appears as a dark flame that takes fuel and light energy to burn hotter and faster than typical fire. Its speed and heat makes it a very dangerous focus. Replica kni are almost always specialists in this class.</p> <p>The form focus is a focus that only replica kni can use. Replica kni can see a living thing, internalize it, and alter their energy-matter makeup to take its form. However, this transformation is not complete. They can never mask their cool-white glowing irises, which ends up being a giveaway of a replica kni.</p> <p>Among the focus classes are advanced focuses that don't fit into a singular class. Using advanced focuses feels like taking your energy into your own hands, and telling it exactly what to do. Of these, we know of rift, direct rift, feel energies, hide energy, and alloying. There have been advanced focuses in the past that the techniques for have since been lost to time, giving them legendary status, like focus binding.</p>"},{"location":"Vignettes/Copper%20counting%20in%20Knilang%20in%20realm%2025/","title":"Copper counting in Knilang in realm 25","text":"<p>recorded through Saul's very tiny rift by Zinc Lithium</p> <p>Copper: \"Fir, sir, thir, fov, fiv, siv, sev, ev, nev, tev.\" \"Tevfir, tevsir, tevthir, tevfor, tevfiv, tevsiv, tevsev, tevev, tevnev, sirtev.\" \"...Sirtev-fir.\"</p> <p>\"And zero is nir.\"</p> <p>\"Thirtevfir, fovtevfir, fivtevfir...

He asked, \"If kni aren't biological, why does alcohol affect them?\"</p> <p>Kni are almost entirely energy, but alcohol still affects them because it's flammable and turns so easily into energy.</p> <p>That's what I said in the moment. Let me expand on that here. </p> <p>Kni are almost entirely energy, but alcohol still affects them because it's flammable, and turns to easily into energy. Being \"drunk,\" for a kni, is essentially just an energy flood that makes things run a little loose. Kni, being part physical but mostly energetic, basically get overloaded with energy from alcohol, literally changing the ratio of energy to physical matter in their bodies. This alteration in the ratio of physical matter to energy influences the kni's actions and shifts them into a softened mental state, very closely emulating human drunkenness. </p> <p>On a sidenote, \"blushing,\" for kni, is perhaps a way for the kni's body to slowly use up the energy flood. It's not literally blushing, like how one's blood flushes their face. \"blushing,\" or glowing, for kni has nothing to do with their essence. It's simply a coalescence of energy in a single spot, making the kni unconsciously focus, causing a purple glow and using energy. A similar, but far less extreme, flood of energy can be caused by extreme emotional states. For instance: embarrassment, excitement, surprise, or attraction. </p> <p>Though, depending on the extremity of the energy imbalance, the negative repercussions of drunkenness are also emulated quite closely. Emotional imbalances aren't typically ever strong enough to cause this, but the kni's body will slow its burning of food into energy due to the sheer imbalance, unfortunately shifting the scale to the other side. This typically lasts for about a day, and leads to the kni's body having less energy than usual, leading to migraines and/or headaches. It's not quite understood why or how kni get headaches. </p> <p>Needless to say, the First Man knew what he was doing with focus.</p> <p>... </p> <p>Some kni have...now, this is rather uncommon, but some kni have had success in alloying by inducing emotional energy floods through various means, harnessing the excess energy.

This is the most possible reason in my eyes. As we know, kni are not mammals, and do not produce milk. Perhaps otherwise, there would be little to tell focus signature by?

Monklike kni often look more at the forest rather than the trees, typically concerning themselves about the bigger picture than small details of individuals. This does not mean that they don't care when one of their own go missing. They will see the effect of the missing party's absence, and will fight to bring them back, even if they don't know the missing party. Kni, especially monklike kni, don't leave their comrades behind if it's in their power to do so. This doesn't mean, however, that monklike kni don't form relationships to individuals. They do, much in the same way we or humanlike kni would. It just means that the overall is above self. This also does not mean that they completely ignore self, either. Amethyst has a line of purple dye in her hair, but she's also a very useful unit of the resistance, teaching the young teen class group.
