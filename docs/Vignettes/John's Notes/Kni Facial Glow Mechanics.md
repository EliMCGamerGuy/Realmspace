# Kni Facial Glow Mechanics
written by John Hayes

I got asked a question a while ago by one of the school-age humans of the Resistance. He asked, "If kni aren't biological, why does alcohol affect them?"

Kni are almost entirely energy, but alcohol still affects them because it's flammable and turns so easily into energy.

That's what I said in the moment. Let me expand on that here. 

Kni are almost entirely energy, but alcohol still affects them because it's flammable, and turns to easily into energy. Being "drunk," for a kni, is essentially just an energy flood that makes things run a little loose. Kni, being part physical but mostly energetic, basically get overloaded with energy from alcohol, literally changing the ratio of energy to physical matter in their bodies. This alteration in the ratio of physical matter to energy influences the kni's actions and shifts them into a softened mental state, very closely emulating human drunkenness. 

On a sidenote, "blushing," for kni, is perhaps a way for the kni's body to slowly use up the energy flood. It's not literally blushing, like how one's blood flushes their face. "lushing," or glowing, for kni has nothing to do with their essence. It's simply a coalescence of energy in a single spot, making the kni unconsciously focus, causing a purple glow and using energy. A similar, but far less extreme, flood of energy can be caused by extreme emotional states. For instance: embarrassment, excitement, surprise, or attraction. 

Though, depending on the extremity of the energy imbalance, the negative repercussions of drunkenness are also emulated quite closely. Emotional imbalances aren't typically ever strong enough to cause this, but the kni's body will slow its burning of food into energy due to the sheer imbalance, unfortunately shifting the scale to the other side. This typically lasts for about a day, and leads to the kni's body having less energy than usual, leading to migraines and/or headaches. It's not quite understood why or how kni get headaches. 

Needless to say, the First Man knew what he was doing with focus.

Some kni have...now, this is rather uncommon, but some kni have had success in alloying by inducing emotional energy floods through various means, harnessing the excess energy. However, Sapphire says the affect is negligible and works only as placebo. She is also worried that kni might start disrobing when completely unneeded. I concur. I know there's nothing actually there, but I don't need that visual in the first place.
