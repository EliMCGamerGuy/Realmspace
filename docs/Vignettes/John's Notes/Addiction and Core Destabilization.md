# Addiction and Core Destabilization
written by John Hayes

---

Well, I should've expected this. Got asked if, since kni aren't biological, but alcohol still affects them, can they become addicted or if it's harmless.

Seriously, I'm not the only one you can ask. Amethyst or Radium could tell you just as well, they literally teach the teen kids.

But as long as we're here, I am the one who'll write you a short essay about it. There isn't really the same function there to make alcohol addictive for kni. They can get accustomed to the "soft" feeling it provides, sure, but there's no actual biological compulsion for them, so it isn't addictive. However, it isn't harmless. The Resistance bar cuts kni off nearly daily. I have to thank Jonas for his excellent work there, because without him we'd have a lot more core destabilizations.

Core destabilization occurs when the ratio of energy to physical matter becomes too out of sync. The kni's body will literally halt energy production from food and drink. This includes the unprocessed alcohol. This process is hard to restart, and almost never happens naturally, typically requiring medical assistance. Again, alcohol is NOT harmless to kni.
