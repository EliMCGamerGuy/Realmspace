# On Names and Cobalt(but mostly Cobalt)
written by John Hayes

---

Humanlike kni get their last names from their fathers, much like we do. Humanlike kni maintain more human names, while monklike kni name typically name their alloys after materials or elements, and the alloy's last names are their father's first name. Case in point, Cobalt. A mix of both.

Full name being Cobalt Wilton, Cobalt is a humanlike kni who never really knew her parents. Her late brother, Ferrite, said when I brought him on that their father was a humanlike and their mother was a monklike. This gave them the stigma among less favorable kni of being, quoting Ferrite, "mixed essences." The more acceptable term is "true alloy." Their parents were both claimed several years before the uprising, relatively early in Cobalt's life, leaving Ferrite to take care of her. She was about 6 at the time. Ferrite would then give his life to protect his sister after the uprising. I can tell his passing affected her greatly.

Just like Jessie's did with me.
