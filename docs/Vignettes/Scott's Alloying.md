# Scott's Alloying
written by Sapphire Bronze

(06/17/2AU)
Shelia and Luke kneeling, knees touching, heads together. Shelia's hands resting in Luke's, their hands glowing a distinct purple. They used birch ash, left to burn completely then cool.


A line of sweat, slightly glowing, forms on Luke's brow. Shelia's hair falls around her face. They'd tried before, but hadn't quite gotten it. 


Some of the ash starts to lift off of their hands.


Sapphire's note: Alloy successful.

Luke exhales. Shelia laughs slightly.
They named him Scott.
