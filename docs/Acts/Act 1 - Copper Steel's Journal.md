# Act 1 - Copper Steel's Journal
Annotated by Copper Steel in 5AU

---

### Entry 1 (5/10/1533) (1BU)
Mom gave me this journal when I turned 17, saying that it's a good thing to write things down. Well, when have I ever denied her suggestion?...don't answer that. I'm not only getting to it a year later.


(Sapphire Brass)
	Mom. Heh. She'd claim me if she heard me call her by name. Mom's a monklike kni, like me, though I guess that's pretty obvious. She taught me how to make those illusion light orbs. They're really useful, I use them a lot nowadays.



### Entry 2 (5/17/1533) (1BU)
This week, we were tasked with counting how many kni to humans are in the school. We found that it's roughly a 66 - 33 split, but most people don't usually opt take focus classes, so it's more like a 85 to 15% split.

Our focus histories teacher said that those numbers should be higher, just in case people need to fend off weaponized focus.



### Entry 3 (5/24/1533) (1BU)
John and Jessie ran a rock-shears-paper tournament this week. They had all players go best of three with his or her set opponent. A kni called Platinum won, I only made it to the semifinals.


(Johnathan Hayes)
	John's a funny one. Brown hair. From a distance, you'd swear he was a humanlike, but he's only human. Opted to take the more focus-oriented classes, though. Twins with Jessie.
	
(Jessica Hayes)
	Also known as Jessie. Or Jess. Or "You" by John. Jessie's a human, but by the way she holds a sword, you'd swear she focused it with every ounce of her energy. You wouldn't think so at first by looking at her, but she's rather strong. Twins with John.



### Entry 4 (5/31/1533) (1BU)
It's sparring tournament week! We were all given these wooden swords and shields, and had to back the other out of a circle or knock the sword out of their hand. Dad attended when I was up. I feel like him being there drove me further, but a kid named Kai knocked me out anyway. Oh well. Dad said "You can't win them all," when we were leaving.


(Steel Brass)
	Dad. Officer in Crystallyne's guard. Monklike kni, like mom and I. Mom sewed on some armored padding to the inside of his robe. I know his dark gray mustache anywhere.



### Entry 5 (6/7/1533) (1BU)
This week, we learned the basics of heal. I'm not very good at it so far, but I'm able to heal paper cuts pretty well. Kni can't get infections but humans can, so to safely heal them you must first wash the wound then use heal.

I feel sorry for the people who help with this class...



### Entry 6 (6/14/1533) (1BU)
When I got back home on the 14th, dad seemed to be worried while reading the paper. He had just gotten back from work, his armored robe hung up. I didn't ask him what was wrong as I could tell from how he was sitting that he didn't want to be disturbed. Mom had noticed it too, I asked her later on. I also asked her if she knew what was worrying him, but she said didn't know.



### Entry 7 (6/21/1533) (1BU)
John and Jessie had a falling out of sorts. This week is combat focus class, so they decided to spar on it...Jessie won. 



### Entry 8 (6/28/1533) (1BU)
Cobalt, Amethyst, and I learned vine this month. I still don't have that good of a grasp on it. Cobalt actually learned how to make ropes with the vines! I don't know if they were strong at all, she didn't let me test it. We also learned that ancient humanlike kni used to use vine and grow to create houses and entire towns made out of pure nature. I'm not usually one for history, but that's pretty cool. Unfortunately, such structures were not well suited for natural disasters.


(Cobalt Wilton)
	I don't know too much about Cobalt. She's a slim humanlike kni with black hair. Black's an unusual hair color for humanlike, but it's not my business. She's rather quiet. She's friends with Amethyst, though. Sister of Ferrite.
	
(Amethyst Silver)
	Also known as Amy, Amethyst is a monklike kni. Amethyst was almost always near the top of our class. 



### Entry 9 (7/5/1533) (1BU)
We're on summer break now :)
I went to the park with Zinc. He brought a board game he imported. It was...I won't sugarcoat it, I hate realm 10's Monopoly.


(Zinc Lithium)
	I've known Zinc for as long as I can remember. Zinc's a monklike kni. We've actually been asked a time or two if we're related. Nope, just good friends.



### Entry 10 (7/12/1533) (1BU)
Many times this month I've heard dad through the walls. Mom's been trying to figure out why he's worried, no matter the cost. He's worried about the "guard situation," and says he can't go in depth about it. Mom and I hope that he gets it figured out soon.



### Entry 11 (7/19/1533) (1BU)
Zinc's still worse at battleship than me! Granted, I didn't do too well either, haha!



### Entry 12 (7/26/1533) (1BU)
Our group had a picnic this afternoon. Cobalt's brother's a little strange...He didn't want to sit down, opting instead to lean against the tree, even after I cleared him a space on the blanket.

Cobalt denied to elaborate when I asked, and that's fine. It's probably personal.



### Entry 13 (8/2/1533) (1BU)
Zinc's slightly younger cousin invited us to the nearby lake along with a friend of hers named Luke. I'm going to be honest, I'm getting a little lost thinking about how Shelia's related to Zinc, but I guess that's irrelevant. Don't know who Luke is, but I guess I will soon.


(Shelia Rogers)
	Shelia is a humanlike kni who's also Zinc's cousin. Don't think about that relation too hard. She's also about a year older than me. 
	

(Luke Daniels)
	Brown hair, suggestion of facial hair. Luke's a humanlike kni. He's not related to us.



### Entry 14 (8/9/1533) (1BU)
Turns out Shelia & Luke are a bit more than friends. Didn't know that, do now. Felt a little awkward. Luke's cool. I didn't talk with him much, though. Not my place to make a judgement anyway.



### Entry 15 (8/16/1533) (1BU)
Dad sat us down last night, and told us the situation. He said that he really shouldn't, but mom's persistence has really been getting to him. Apparently, unrest has been building in replica kni tribes. The Crystallyne guard fear they may stage an attack. Dad hopes not. He says their combined power might be too much for the city.



### Entry 16 (8/23/1533) (1BU)
don't play uno with zinc



### Entry 17 (8/30/1533) (1BU)
Back to school next week. I was out with John and Jessie. While I was talking, I misspoke, and almost said that I have feelings for Amethyst(which I guess is true). After John and Jessie pulled it out of me, I confessed to them that I have feelings for her, but don't know how to tell her. They decided that they'll figure something out next week. I fear what they have in mind.



### Entry 18 (9/6/1533) (1BU)
John and Jessie plotted out an entire plan to make the situation perfect for me to tell Amy that I have feelings for her. John stood by the sidelines and Jessie stood next to me as I used my locker. Amy came by and Jessie nudged me with her elbow, hard. It almost knocked me over, but thankfully it didn't. I then looked over to Amy as she was using her locker and told her that I had feelings for her. I was nervous and stumbled over my words, but after a few awkward seconds, she accepted. I could see John in the distance pump his fist in the air. Amy insisted that I start calling her Amy instead of Amethyst, though.

...John was literally moral support.

And he pulled it off, too.



### Entry 19 (9/13/1533) (1BU)
Dad didn't come back from work on the 10th. Mom and I are eagerly awaiting his return.



### Entry 20 (9/20/1533) (1BU)
We're starting to worry about dad. He hasn't been back in a week. It's really eerie.

Sparring tournament this week. It didn't feel right without dad there. I didn't do great.



### Entry 21 (9/27/1533) (1BU)
Mom keeps dishing out dinner for dad, but he still hasn't returned. She just keeps wrapping the bowls. Then they go bad in a few days.



### Entry 22 (10/4/1533) (1BU)
I turned 18 three days ago. Mom told me about alloying today. She said that dad would be able to phrase it better, but she said that if both kni parents focus their energy into one spot, typically while kneeling and holding hands, there's a chance that an alloy will be created. Not a metallic alloy, but another kni. She said that sometimes, to up the chances, some kni will dust their hands with light-colored ash. She also said that since the two genders of kni have different focus signatures, it takes two to alloy. Two male kni cannot alloy, neither can two female. She added that human reproduction is similar, but very different at the same time. She didn't go into depth about that, guess that's up to my own research.

Sidenote: Jessie and John got rather embarrassed when I asked about the human analog of alloying. John just set his head on the table. Jessie told me, red-faced but smiling, that the cafeteria is not a place for that conversation. That's not a publicly acceptable topic, duly noted. Could've told me that too, MOM.



### Entry 23 (10/11/1533) (1BU)
It's been a month since dad didn't return. We're...starting to really worry. I'm trying to push speculating what happened out of my mind. Nobody has touched his chair in the living room. It's starting to get dusty.



### Entry 24 (10/18/1533) (1BU)
Remember: Amy's birthday is on the 20th of this month.



### Entry 25 (10/25/1533) (1BU)
Didn't forget :)



### Entry 26 (11/1/1533) (1BU)
This week was spear aim practice. You're supposed to counteract spear drop. A spear going about the speed of an arrow may not have much drop in close to mid range, but long range will ruin your aim if you're not adjusting for it. I'm no longer missing the targets entirely at mid range anymore, but I can't quite get long range yet. They always end up sticking into the ground. 



### Entry 27 (11/1/1533) (1BU)
For the life class this week, we took a tour of a hospital. I'm going to be honest, I didn't like the "clean" smell. We're going to be quizzed next life week about the uses of the life class in a hospital.

Nobody with the names Steel or Brass. I checked.



### Entry 28 (11/8/1533) (1BU)
Slept through another focus histories...That's not going to look good.



### Entry 29 (11/15/1533) (1BU)
This week was shield focus practice via shield bashing. You have to push your opponent outside the circle. I didn't do too great, was too easily pushed over. Didn't brace hard enough.



### Entry 30 (11/22/1533) (1BU)
Life class week. We were all given a small potted tree, and had to make it grow. Cobalt had little issue, she just forgot to give it enough water. I think I used too much water... John, given a plant too for some reason, poured some of the water in and said that he has "made the plant grow." Mr. Davis gave him a look, but agreed. I wonder why he opts to take the focus classes.



### Entry 31 (11/23/1533) (1BU)
...



### Entry 32 (11/24/1533) (1BU)
Fell asleep IN my journal last night.



### Entry 33 (12/6/1533) (1BU)
Winter break is coming soon, but combat class waits for no kni(or man). Our combat focus teacher called me over. She had me form my shield...

...

And had Jessie (reluctantly) push me over.

Yes, I get it, bracing is important.



### Entry 34 (12/13/1533) (1BU)
Mom sat me down today, and told me about being claimed. Our hope is starting to slip. There are still searching parties looking for him, but they still haven't found anything. 

Mom says that when a kni gets too weak, or looses too much essence, their energy can be claimed by another kni. Usually, this happens naturally. An old kni will pass his or her energy on to his or her alloys. The claiming process leaves behind a white, ashy residue where the kni used to be. She said that, at this point, that's what the guard is looking for.

I hope not.



### Entry 35 (12/20/1533) (1BU)
Ferrite said Cobalt's birthday is on the 22nd. He's a cool guy, but sometimes a little cold. Quite protective of Cobalt. Not sure why, I didn't ask.


(Ferrite Wilton)
	Cool guy, but quite guarded. Ferrite's a humanlike kni with black hair. He looks rather strong, and it's a little intimidating. He's Cobalt's older brother.



### Entry 36 (12/27/1533) (1BU)
The winter solstice wasn't the same without dad.

I made sure not to let Cobalt and Ferrite down. Mainly Ferrite. He looks like he could probably fold me in half if he needed to...



### Entry 37 (1/3/1534) (0BU)
It's the new year! It's now 1534AM. That's "After Man," not time. Time-wise, it's about 11pm.

There's traces of what looks like flour in the snow. That's odd.



### Entry 38 (1/10/1534) (0BU)
I could've sworn I smelled something burning the other day.

Ok, that's not snow...



### Entry 39 (1/17/1534) (0BU)
There have been reports of blackfires in the nearby woods. Well, that's one mystery solved. Another started, what is a blackfire?? The guard is doubling. We are to expect a replica kni attack. Dad is a military officer. His being missing doesn't fill us with confidence...



### Entry 40 (1/24/1534) (0BU)
There's been rumors of replica kni in the city perimeter. Mom says they're just rumors, and that she hasn't seen any.



### Entry 41 (1/31/1534) (0BU)
Well, that's unmistakable. Zinc and I took a bit of a bicycle ride against out better judgement. The outskirts of the city are being burned with what looks like black fire.

OOOHHHH

There wasn't anyone around, maybe they already got an evacuation notice out to the people there.



### Entry 42 (2/7/1534) (0BU)
The guard has released a warning confirming sightings of replica kni INSIDE the city...

That's...

That's not good.



### Entry 43 (2/14/1534) (0BU)
Zinc and I bike over to what the guard's been calling "the perimeter" now and then. They've sent out a memo telling everyone that can to stay within their homes. But the guard is getting tired. Zinc and I watching from as close as we dare...There's a lot of wounded people. A healer told us to go home.

If it keeps like this, would we be safe there?

The ash is..."whiter" today. It almost looks like snow, but it doesn't pack.



### Entry 44 (2/21/1534) (0BU)
*(There's a piece of paper taped into the journal.)*

"CRYSTALLYNE GUARD PUBLIC MEMO

As you've probably heard from the rumors, the guard is wearing out. We've entered talks with the attacking replica kni. Their demands for peace are...disturbing. And what's worse is that they don't seem to be willing to compromise yet.

We will continue peace talks as time goes on. If you are able, please continue to stay in your houses. Your safety is our priority.

 ~ The Crystallyne Guard"

This was in the mail today. Mom is worried. I can see why.



### Entry 45 (2/28/1534) (0BU)
*(There's another piece of paper taped into the journal.)*

"CRYSTALLYNE GUARD PUBLIC WARNING ANNOUNCEMENT

TO ALL HUMAN CITIZENS OF CRYSTALLYNE CITY:

AN EVACUATION HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR REGIONS WITHIN 20 MILES OF THE PERIMETER. PLEASE SEEK THE CLOSEST KNI-RUN SHELTER AND AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTION. SEE ENCLOSED REGION MAP TO SEE IF THIS EVACUATION APPLIES TO YOUR AREA.

~ The Crystallyne Guard"

 They're too small. John, Jessie and I explored one last year. They're only built to house about three people, there's just not enough of them.
 
 John and Jessie say they're going to stay still. We're not in the evacuation zone, so it should be fine.



### Entry 46 (3/7/1534) (0BU)
*(There's another piece of paper taped in.)*
"CRYSTALLYNE GUARD IMMEDIATE WARNING ANNOUNCEMENT

TO ALL CITIZENS WHO RECIEVE THIS:

PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED REPORTS OF REPLICA-TYPE KNI IN YOUR AREA.

THE REPLICA KNI HAVE PASSED THE PERIMETER.

THEIR INTENT IS TO HARM HUMANS AND POSSIBLY ENSLAVE KNI.

IT IS ADVISED TO STAY OUT OF SIGHT, AND USE ILLUSION FOCUS TO HIDE YOUR SIGNATURES.

STAY SAFE"


*(There's nothing else on the page. Just a lone ink dot.)*



### Entry 47 (3/8/1534) (0BU)
My entries are daily now. There's too much happening to keep weekly entries anymore.

When the wolves passed our house, I felt relieved at first. But mom knew. She pointed out their eyes. That cold white that replica kni can never hide, even with form focus.


When she was sure they were gone, we, along with Cobalt, Ferrite, Amy, and a few others, left for one of the old watchtowers, just beyond the city's limit. It was dad's station when he was younger. 


I found a few drawings in a dusty desk drawer with dad's name on it. If this is him... Man. I do look like a younger him. I've always seen dad with his touch-of-gray mustache, I've never seen him like this.



### Entry 48 (3/9/1534) (0BU)
The city is billowing with smoke. You can't even see the buildings for the smoke.

In the commotion, I hadn't even seen Zinc, John or Jessie. Not to mention Shelia or Luke. I hope they're ok.



### Entry 49 (3/10/1534) (0BU)
The city is still smothered in smoke, but it seems to be dy#ng d#wn n#w.

*(The text is scratched away.)*

The city is still covered in smoke, but it seems to be slowly clearing now.

Mom says we're going to see what's left tomorrow. We're spending another night in the tower.



### Entry 50 (3/11/1534) (0BU)
Crystallyne is hardly recognizable...
The street is covered in ash and blood...What's really nagging at me right now is where John and Jessie are, especially with blood literally lining the street.

One of the kni that was with us in the tower, Saul, said that he's going to try to provide off-world passage to all humans he finds. He handed me his realmspace star map. Opening rifts isn't something I know how to do, but Saul said he'd teach me tomorrow. He said he saw something in me. Not sure what that means, but I hope I don't disappoint.

(Saul Friedman)
	A well-meaning guy. Saul is a humanlike kni, and professional realmspace navigator.
	

We found Zinc- or I guess he found us. He told us to get down out of sight as fast as possible. He's been watching the wolves, he said they take Stable St. pretty often.

I tried to ask about John and Jessie, but he didn't know either. Again, I hope they're ok.

Huh. Cobalt and Ferrite must've gone somewhere. They're not with us anymore.


Our house is a wreck. Mom mapped out where the floor once was, and confirmed that the suspiciously chair-shaped ash pile was dad's chair. She knelt down in front of it silently.

At least my room still has somewhat of a roof.



### Entry 51 (3/12/1534) (0BU)
Apparently, the wolf replica kni are prowling, seeking out and killing any humans they find with blackfire. That means that Saul, I, and a few other realmspace navigators have some competition. Saul said that blackfire is a type of flame only created by focus, that takes fuel and light to burn hotter than a normal flame. It's against Crystallyne law to teach it, and the replica kni use it as a weapon. Aye.

Saul taught me how to open a rift into realmspace today. Realmspace is a very vast, empty area. The ground is like this black sand. The stars in the sky, a little too perfect, unmoving, and every single one representing another realm. Saul taught me that walking in a star's direction will make the others start to fade. It's at that point that you can open a rift into that realm. Apparently, the stars only appear to kni. I'm not sure how that works, it might have to do with our eyes.

All the stars are in slightly random-looking constellations. Each one is different, however. That's how you can know which one is which. Realm 04 is in the Y constellation, and it's marked as one of the "habitable" realms.

What makes a realm inhabitable??



### Entry 52 (3/13/1534) (0BU)
I got woken up at the crack of dawn by screaming. *Pained* screaming. Not John or Jessie, thankfully, but I still couldn't get back to sleep.



### Entry 53 (3/14/1534) (0BU)
It's time for our first refugee run. Saul taught Amy only because she insisted. She's furious that the replica burned the school before graduation. She says she was on track to apply for a few advanced focus colleges. I never once thought about that. Hmm. 

Saul rounded up about 10 people for off-realm relocation. Perfect since there's about 10 of us. He gave them each a choice for which realm to go to. He had this notebook by the end, describing the most viable realms. Realm 25 seemed the most viable by far, it's what most chose.

Amy took my notebook out of my satchel- rude- and wrote her name on it with a purple marker if we ever get separated. I guess the rudeness can be excused, haha.

I guided a man to realm 27.


Mom sliced some bread when I got home. It's a little burnt and she had some issue opening the metal breadbox, but it was ok, I guess. A little stale.



### Entry 54 (3/15/1534) (0BU)
Saul rounded up about 20 people this time. Seems like word of mouth spreads quickly, and people are desperate for a way out. I think a number of people ran into the woods nearby the city. I don't know what happened to them.

I'm keeping an eye out for Jessie and John. I still haven't seen them.

A man and a woman to Realm 31.



### Entry 55 (3/16/1534) (0BU)
I got woken up forcibly this morning by a replica kni holding me up by my shirt collar. There was three of them, they took the form of humanlike kni. I remember word for word what the one holding me said, and I don't think I'll soon forget his eyes. His gruff voice. His slightly annoyed-sounding grunt.

"Mmh. Two monklikes. Write that down."

And he dropped me. *Two.* They must've counted mom too. One of them picked up my satchel(containing my notebook, journal, realmspace map, a few pens and some ink), and rifled through it. He pulled out the realmspace star map. I said it was for school. I hope it wasn't too fast a response, because the one who had held me up looked at me and raised an eyebrow. Then the one holding my satchel dropped it. 

And they left.


I...never want that to happen again.

*(Copper's script wavers slightly.)*



### Entry 56 (3/16/1534) (0BU)
Saul rounded up more people. about 35 this time. I told him what happened. His eyes widened, but we continued anyway. I opened my rift last as I usually do and brought the people to their destination, realm 27. A woman and a girl. I didn't ask if they were related, it's not my business.

But now it seems I can't go back.

Realm 04's star isn't here.

I don't understand, does it have to do with the star map? The replica kni this morning? Realm 04's supposed to be in the center of the Y constellation, but it's just...not?

I'm trying to open a rift anyway, but I just can't! It doesn't open! Even bracing myself against the ground and twisting with my whole arm, it still doesn't budge!

Usually, it's just focus, chop, twist, and pull to size to open a rift, why is it so hard now??



### Entry 57 (3/17?/1534) (0BU)
I've been walking in the direction of where realm 04's star should be for what feels like hours now, trying to open the rift every now and then. The other stars have long since dimmed. If I don't focus on the sky, it doesn't even look like they're there. Realmspace doesn't give much to tell time by, and I'm really lucky I know illusion focus to give myself some light to write by.



### Entry 58 (3/18??/1534) (0BU)
I slept on the black sand in realmspace. How long? Eight hours? Four? Two? Half an hour? I honestly have no clue...I just know that the sand is getting into my robe, and it's really uncomfortable.



### Entry 59 (3/19??/1534) (0BU)
Slept in realmspace again. The sand is starting to get into my satchel too, now. Regardless, the wind in this place makes me feel strangely energized now and then. I guess this *is* where we pull our energy from.

I've decided to check the habitable realms for any signs of anyone I recognize. Either that, or I just want out of this darn black sand.

Who am I kidding, it's probably both.



### Entry 60 (3/20??/1534) (0BU)
Realm 01: The first realm. That energized feeling is really strong here! It's strangely peaceful, but that abundance of energy is staggering! There's nobody here, though. Well, not anymore according to the story of the Man.



### Entry 61 (3/21??/1534) (0BU)
Sleeping here proved difficult with the charge in the air! But I got there in the end.

Realm 03: This realm has nothing in it. It's technically habitable, but it's just a void with a solid, smooth white floor.



### Entry 62 (3/22??/1534) (0BU)
Sleeping here was like sleeping on a rock. I feel like I might've rathered the sand instead. At least that gave somewhat.

Realm 05: Still no luck with trying to find people I know. This realm has bipedal pig-people, though. That's a little strange.



### Entry 63 (3/23??/1534) (0BU)
Slept under a tree. Probably the best I've had in the realms so far.

Realm 08: Forgot to raise my hood. Some people called me a "demon." Nobody I recognize. Found a few copper-colored coins on the ground. I slipped them into my satchel. Just need to remember that this is realm 08 money.



### Entry 64 (3/24??/1534) (0BU)
Sleeping here was ok, I guess. Would've been better if the ground here wasn't as hard.

Realm 10: I'm not technically supposed to be here. Usually it's the humanlike kni that run imports from realm 10. The people here call it earth. I'm pretty convinced that there's no kni here, though. I did find a pair of old gloves and some sunglasses. I put them on and raised my hood, looking at my reflection. My robe is one of dad's old ones. I've never grown into it like he insisted I would, so the hood covers my head almost entirely. It's perfect, actually.



### Entry 65 (3/25??/1534) (0BU)
Sleeping here was fine. Pretty middle-of-the-road.

Realm 11: This realm's ground naturally forms cubes. It's actually pretty interesting. But there doesn't seem to be anyone here. Oh well.



### Entry 66 (3/26??/1534) (0BU)
Well, it's pretty interesting until you need to sleep on it. Those edges are sharp and not comfortable!

Realm 14: This realm has human civilization in it too. Nobody I know, though. Foraging here is pretty good, though. Found a number of blueberries and I think wild onions.



### Entry 67 (3/27??/1534) (0BU)
Hah, forgot blueberries makes your focus turn blue for a while. That tripped me up for a moment!

Realm 15: Nothing. The only energy I can feel here is my own. Hmmh.



### Entry 68 (3/28??/1534) (0BU)
That was...probably the calmest night I've had so far. However, the search continues.

Realm 17: This realm has three moons! That's rather interesting, most realms only have one, like 04 and 10. Other than that interesting tidbit, though, there's not much here. No people. Found an apple tree, though. That was nice.



### Entry 69 (3/29??/1534) (0BU)
The ground underneath this tree is actually kind of soft.

Realm 19: When I got here and started exploring, I was spotted by some people, a solid couple heads shorter than me. They were curious what brought me to their region. I said I was looking for my people, not saying too much. They said that they haven't seen anyone pass through with a robe like mine in a long time, but they have a spare room underground if I need it. I accepted and thanked them. Being in an actual room makes a giant difference, even if I need to duck through a few hallways to get there and the bed is a stone slab with a pelt over it.



### Entry 70 (3/30??/1534) (0BU)
...I'm going to have to ask them what kind of pelt that is.

They said bear. I'm a little afraid of them now.

Anyway, back to the search.

Realm 21: Immensely foggy. I couldn't even see my outstretched arm! And it was an eerie silent. I didn't stay for long. Backtracked through the rift and had to let my journal dry before writing this.



### Entry 71 (4?/1??/1534) (0BU)
I have officially lost almost all concept of time. Thanks realmspace. Slept in the room in realm 19. Thanked the people again.

Realm 24: Not much here. Just an extreme hill with a few cows. At this rate, I don't think I'd bat an eye if someone here decided that these cows were their family.



### Entry 72 (4?/2??/1534) (0BU)
Slept amongst the mountain cows.

Realm 25: I found a dilapidated cabin in the woods here. There's nobody around and no town nearby. There's a river with fish nearby, though. Took a closer look at the cabin. The door's slightly broken, the window's shattered, the interior looks like it hasn't been touched in years, there's a couple logs coming out of the wall on the outside, there's vines almost covering one side, and the bed inside feels like it's almost literally calling to me.

I decided that I'm going to stay here for a bit.

I took down the vines. I wish I knew how Cobalt made those vine ropes. Alas. I also put the logs that were falling out back into the wall, and tied them with the vines that I took down.

Going back inside, I found out there was a bookshelf. Almost all the books are water damaged, though.



### Entry 73 (4?/3??/1534) (0BU)
Turns out that bed's so comfortable, I laid back on it and fell asleep. Well, comparatively speaking. The smell and stiffness leaves things to be desired, but it's better than stone. Could do with a bear pelt, though.

That was the first time I've slept and not thought about that day the replica kni woke me up. It was only, what, two, three weeks ago? But I remember it like it was yesterday.

I think I'm going to hang out here for a while. It's cozy here.



### Entry 74 (4?/4??/1534) (0BU)
I tried to read some of the old water damaged books, but most of them were all stuck together, or mostly stuck together, or rather moldy. I'll continue my search tomorrow, I just fashioned a net with the vines, and I'm going to test it in the river.

Well, it almost didn't, but the vine net worked! Caught a pretty good-sized fish. I think it's a bass? I'm not sure, I've never actually gone fishing before. Helped mom prepare them, though, so I know at least some of what I'm doing.

The cabin has a wood-fired stove. Do I trust it? No. Should I? Definitely not. Am I going to use it anyway? Probably.

Turned out fine, had fish for dinner...once I managed to actually start a fire. At least there was a ferrite rod in the drawer next to the stove. Oh! That's where his name comes from!

Can't lose sight of my goal, though. I have to continue searching tomorrow.



### Entry 75 (4?/5??/1534) (0BU)
Woke up rather rested today. Took the opportunity to shake out my clothes and satchel. If only I had a broom for this old floor. I hooked the ferrite rod to my belt. You never know when you need fire, right?

Realm 27: No luck, no focus signatures nearby again. Found some of the people we helped, though. It was nice to catch up with them. They said that, in the month they've been here, they were able to integrate pretty well. No kni here, though.

The parks here are rather beautiful.

### Entry 76 (4?/6??/1534) (0BU)
I accidentally slept on a park bench. Man, that does not help one's back.

Realm 31: This realm was a wide open field, with only a couple people here. They weren't immediately scared when they saw me step through the rift. I like that.



### Entry 77 (4?/7??/1534) (0BU)
Slept in the tall grass. It was rather pleasant.

Realm 32: No focus signatures here either. I would understand, too. This realm is just barely warm enough to be habitable.

Went back to the cabin to sleep, I'm not sleeping here.



### Entry 78 (4?/8??/1534) (0BU)
Finally shook out the bed covering. It looks almost pristine underneath it...Still smells damp, though. Shame this blanket ruins how it looks. And smells. The blanket smells like a humid basement.

It's kind of cloudy out, I hope it doesn't rain. I have my doubts that this roof would hold water.

Realm 33: Struck out again. Just animals here. The sun here is purple, and the plants are this kind of blue. That's pretty interesting. It makes it look like I'm always focusing, haha. Not enough, though. No people here.



### Entry 79 (4?/9??/1534) (0BU)
I'm coming to the end of the realmspace sequence. Well, the habitable realms anyway. It's making me worried.

Realm 35: Can't feel if anyone's here. It's just sand for miles. A seemingly infinite desert.

I'm not sleeping in sand again.



### Entry 80 (4?/10??/1534) (0BU)
Slept in the bed again. I took the blanket down to the river to try and clean it but now it's soaked.

They say that going to realm 38's star sends you where you belong. It's only a tale, so I've never tried it. Never needed to. Guess it's worth a shot, right?

Ok, real funny, realmspace. It opened a rift to the cabin in realm 25. I guess even realm 38's star can't get to realm 04.

But that was the last of the habitable realms. What do I do now?



### Entry 81 (4?/11??/1534) (0BU)
After another day of trying to read damaged books without breaking them, I decided that I'm going to leave marks in the realms. I'm going to take a few rocks that I found and try to carve into stone in the realms, in Knilang, "Copper in cabin realm 25."

Knilang is like a broken Latin. Or maybe Latin is a broken Knilang? I don't know, but they're really similar. All I know is that we were required to learn it in school.

Maybe someone will be able to read them.

Amy, Zinc, Mom? Heck, Saul? I'd take anyone at this point.



### Entry 82 (4?/??/1534) (0BU)
I have fully lost any and all form of keeping realm 04's time. I slept through the morning, through the afternoon, and I honestly don't know if I slept an entire day away or not. I just know that when I woke up, I was rather stiff.

I have to start conserving my journal pages, I only have a few left. It's only an 95-page journal.



### Entry 83 (Winter, I think/1534) (0BU)
I think today is the winter solstice in realm 25. It's hard to tell when you don't have the instruments required to accurately predict it.

This is going to be my first winter solstice away from family.

It almost makes the snow outside feel colder.



### Entry 84 (Spring, I think/1535) (1AU)
I think it's the next year now. Has to be. It's spring here in realm 25. As I expected, the roof leaks like a sieve, so I've been trying to gather as much information as I can about roofing. Now it's half thatch, but at least it holds water. I can get rid of the buckets around now.



### Entry 85 (Winter, I think/1535) (1AU)
Another solstice away.

Mom makes these wonderful apple pies during this time of the year. She gets them in autumn, and then keeps them cold for roughly a month until she's ready to make the pie.

Man, I'm getting tired of fish.



### Entry 86 (Spring, I think/1536) (2AU)
And that's another year.

I'm finding wild onions and things. Maybe I should go to one of the other realms and get some packs of seeds.



### Entry 87 (Winter, I think/1536) (2AU)
My first winter solstice with fresh-ish vegetables. I literally have all the cucumbers I could ever want.

Dad used to light the fire pit in our back yard on the winter solstice. Then, he'd get out some imported graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate bars, and Zinc and I would have warm smores in the winter night, warmed by the fire.

I'm out here with a campfire, started with this ferrite rod and an old, dull knife from the cabin. My best approximation.



### Entry 88 (Spring, I think/1537) (3AU)
I traded my extra vegetables for more seeds a while back. Now my garden's even bigger.

At what point does it become a farm?



### Entry 89 (Winter, I think/1537) (3AU)
As I sit in front of the campfire again, I get to wondering if anyone's actually seen my marks. Technically, it's cross-dimensional vandalism. But...it's for a good reason, I think.



### Entry 90 (Spring, I think/1538) (4AU)
I saw a fox the other day. I didn't even know there were foxes in this realm.

I had to re-thatch because the roof started leaking again.

You know, I really hope nobody ever comes over here. After working in the garden, I'm so covered in sweat, I'm basically idly giving off a faint purple glow. And that stuff does not like to wash out of monklike clothes. At least the glow fades slowly when in contact with water.

I swear, if a fish learns how to use focus...



### Entry 91 (Winter, I think/1538) (4AU)
Man, I wish I had my top cloak. It's pretty much a small cloak, only going down about the length of a shirt, that goes over your standard robe. They're so much warmer than the robe alone. Almost uncomfortably so. And they're pretty much waterproof. I remember mom throwing a minor fit because I had spilled something on mine and she had to clean it, and cleaning it is rather hard due to it being nearly waterproof.



### Entry 92 (Spring, I think/1539) (5AU)
I'm looking into getting one of those straw hats from one of the vendors in realm 27 to keep the sun out of my eyes.

Oh gosh, am I a farmer now?



### Entry 93 (Summer, I think/1539??) (5AU??)
You ever get woken up by having a cassette tape thrown at your head by evidently nobody? Well, now I can truthfully say that nonsense sentence. I don't have a player, but that label in Zinc's handwriting..."For CU29"... For Copper. For me. 

They're still out there. Somewhere. Now I know. 

But where?



### Entry 94 (Summer, I think/1539??) (5AU??)
Last week, I could've sworn while I was in realmspace, somebody was calling my name. It's probably just the loneliness. Or, maybe the mold in the bed is finally getting to me. Am I just submitting to the rot now?



### Entry 95 (Summer, I think/1539??) (5AU??)
No, there's someone out here. Somewhere. I heard it again. It's faint, I'm going to try to follow it.


Realm 04's star is back.
