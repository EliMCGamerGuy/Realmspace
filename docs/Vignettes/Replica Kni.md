{5AU, The Surveillance break room}
Amy: "Hey, Shelia, you know about realm 10, right?"
Shelia: "A little, watcha need?"
Amy: "I've been doing some reading realm 10 Internet culture in my spare time..."
Shelia: "Ohh boy."
Amy: "There's no way to soften this- are replica kni furries?"
Shelia: *(Place her right hand on her knee, laughing, doubling over)*
Cobalt, in the background, leaning against the wall: *(Eyes widen, she looks away, and mumbles "oh, so we're discussing *this* topic. smooth, ame.")*
Shelia: *(Points to Amy, still doubled over)* "I had never thought about it like that, I love that!"
*(Shelia places her head on the tables briefly, before looking back to Amy, somewhat composed.)*
Shelia: "No, I don't think so. Furries are anthropomorphic animals, and replica kni using form focus are just...animals. So...I don't think they constitute as furries??"
Amy: "Oh, ok. Thanks."
*(Amethyst turns to Cobalt, walking toward her.)*
Amy: "See? I told you last night they weren't furries."
*(Cobalt shrugs with a smirk.)*
