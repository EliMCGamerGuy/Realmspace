# Copper counting in Knilang in realm 25
recorded through Saul's very tiny rift by Zinc Lithium

---

Copper: "Fir, sir, thir, fov, fiv, siv, sev, ev, nev, tev."
"Tevfir, tevsir, tevthir, tevfor, tevfiv, tevsiv, tevsev, tevev, tevnev, sirtev."
"...Sirtev-fir."

"And zero is nir."

"Thirtevfir, fovtevfir, fivtevfir... All the way to un." 

"So...four hundred and fifty-seven would be... forun-fivtevsev." 

"I'm not counting to tevun, much less...uh...tevuntevun? I think that's a million. or was it firtevuntevun? Do you need that explicit fir, or is it implicit like with tevun?"

...

"One million, two hundred thirty-four thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven point eighty-nine."

......

"tevuntevun...siruntevun...thirtevtevun...fovtevun...fivun...sivtev-sev-pot-evtev-nev."

...

"big numbers are easier in English."

Had to boost this by like 40dB to transcribe this! How did you record this, Zinc?? - Shelia
